The way the pictures of antibiograms are taken can facilitate the automatic reading and minimize the risk of errors. In order to standardize picture acquisition we have developped a simple [image acquisition protocol](https://mpascucci.github.io/ASTapp-protocol/). This protocol has been <b>designed with simplicity in mind</b>: it can be implemented with cardboard and simple material tipically available in every laboratory.
