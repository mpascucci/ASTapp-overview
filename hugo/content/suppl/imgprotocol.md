We have developped a simple [image acquisition protocol](https://mpascucci.github.io/ASTapp/) to allow a more standardized picture acquisition that facilitates the automatic reading and minimizes the risk of errors. This protocol has been designed with simplicity in mind: it can be implemented with cardboard and simple material tipically available in every laboratory.
