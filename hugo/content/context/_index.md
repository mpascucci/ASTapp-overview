## <i class="fas fa-biohazard"></i> Antimicrobial Resistance
As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO AMR review), <b>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)</b> is a major public health concern, In 50 years it could become <b>[the first cause of death all over the world](/ASTapp-overview/en/suppl/oneill/)</b> (10 million of death every year in 2050 according the [Oâ€™Neill report](.(https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf)), thereby surpassing cancer.

The access to a good diagnosis of bacterial deseases is usually not available in <b>low-resource settings (LRS)</b>. This leads to non appropriate patient treatment and to the selection of resistant strains because of the non rational use of broad spectrum antibiotics.

## <i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> The antibiogram
[Antibiograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_sensitivity) are an <b>easy-to-implement test</b> for detecting bacteria resistances to antibiotics.
This video carefully explains the principle.

The raw result of an antibiogram needs an interpratation, which in turn requires <b>highly specialized human resources</b> (microbiologists, a rare resource in LRS).

### <span class="ast">AST</span><span class="app">app</span>: a diagnosis tool for everybody

Astapp addresses several of the strategic objectives identified by the <b>[World Health organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/en/)</b> as a <b>[global action plan](https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/en/)</b> to tackle Antimicrobial resistance.
By giving a broad and open access to a better diagnosis, ourproject can:

- "strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research"

- "optimize the use of antimicrobial agents"

Our application has also an <b>educational vocation</b>: througout the automated antibiogram interpretation, it will explain its choices to the user.
