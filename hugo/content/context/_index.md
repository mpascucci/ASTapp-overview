## <i class="fas fa-biohazard"></i> Antimicrobial Resistance
As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO AMR review), <b>Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)</b> is a major public health concern. In 50 years it could become <b> [the first cause of death](/ASTapp-overview/en/suppl/oneill/)</b>  all over the world.

The access to a good diagnosis of bacterial deseases is usually not available in <b>low-resource settings (LRS)</b>. This leads to non appropriate patient treatment and to the selection of resistant strains because of the non rational use of broad spectrum antibiotics.

## <i class="fas fa-dot-circle"></i> The antibiogram
[Antibiograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_sensitivity) are an <b>easy-to-implement test</b> for detecting bacteria resistances to antibiotics.
This video carefully explains the principle.

The raw result of an antibiogram <b>needs to be interpreted by a microbiologist</b>, and microbiologists are a rare in in low resource settings.

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> The Solution

### a free diagnosis tool

{{% ASTapp %}} allows the interpretation of an antibiogram by tacking a picture of it with a smarthpone camera.

{{% ASTapp %}} addresses several of the strategic objectives identified by the <b>[World Health organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/en/)</b> as a <b>[global action plan](https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/global-action-plan/en/)</b> to tackle Antimicrobial resistance.
By giving a broad and open access to a better diagnosis, ourproject can:

- "strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research"

- "optimize the use of antimicrobial agents"

{{% ASTapp %}} has an <b>educational vocation</b> too: throughout the automated antibiogram interpretation, it will explain its choices to the user and teach him how to avoid mistakes.
