## Application home
The user enters the relevant data for the analysis, then takes a picture of the antibiogram with the device camera.

## Petri dish selection
The analysis begins with a step-by-step validation process, where {{% ASTapp %}} asks the user to validate or adjust its automatic results. Here, the app finds the petri dish in the picture.

## Find Antibiotic disks
Then, {{% ASTapp %}} finds the antibiotic antibiotic pellets (small white disks).
If something went wrong, the user can edit and adjust the result (with a zoomed view).

## Read antibiotic names
{{% ASTapp %}} reads the name of the antibiotics, printed on each white disk.

## Measure the inhibition diameters
{{% ASTapp %}} measures the "inhibition diameters", the size of the zones where the bacteria did not grow in proximity of an effective antibiotic. Once again, the user can adjust the automatic measurements.

## Get the interpreted results
With the previously meausred diameters are converted in resistance information. {{% ASTapp %}} shows this result to the user, together with its interpretation: a set of rules is applied to the measured result to check the overall coherence and extrapolate  resistances to other (non-tested) antibiotics.
