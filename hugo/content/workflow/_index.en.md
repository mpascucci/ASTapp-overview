## Application home
The user enters the relevant data for the analysis, then takes a picture of the antibiogram.

## Petri dish selection
The analysis begins, with a step by step validation process, where the app asks the user to validate or adjust the automatic results. Here, the app finds the petri dish in the picture.

## Find Antibiotic disks
Then the app finds the antibiotic bellets (small white disks).
If something went wrong, the user can edit and adjust the result (in zoomed mode).

## Read antibiotic names
The app reads the name of the antibiotics, printed on each white disk.

## Measure the inhibition diameters
The app measures the "inhibition diameters", the size of those zones where the bacteria did not grow in proximity of an effective antibiotic. Once again, the user can adjust the automatic measurements.

## Get the interpreted results
With the previously meausred diameters are converted in Resistance information. The app show this result to the user, together with its interpretation: a set of rules is applied to the measured result to extrapolate other resistances.
