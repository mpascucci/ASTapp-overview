	"content": " Discover the context and the issue that ASTapp addresses.\nAntimicrobial Resistance Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is nowadays a seriously growing concern for public health, as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO AMR review). In 50 years it could become the first cause of death all over the world (10 million of death every year in 2050 according the Oâ€™Neill report), thereby surpassing cancer.\nThe access to a good diagnosis of bacterial deseases is not egalitarian across the globe, leaving some populations with mistreated infections and antibiotic misuse.\n  The antibiogram Antibiograms are an easy-to-implement test for detecting bacteria resistances to antibiotics. This video carefully explains the principle of such test.\n  The Solution ASTapp: a diagnosis tool for everybody Astapp addresses several of the strategic objectives identified by the World Health organization (WHO) as a global action plan to tackle Antimicrobial resistance. By giving a broad and open access to a better diagnosis, ourproject can:\n \u0026ldquo;strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;optimize the use of antimicrobial agents\u0026rdquo;\n  Our application has also an educational vocation: througout the automated antibiogram interpretation, it will explain its choices to the user.\n"

	"content": " Application home The user enters the relevant data for the analysis, then takes a picture of the antibiogram. Petri dish selection The analysis begins, with a step by step validation process, where the app asks the user to validate or adjust the automatic results. Here, the app finds the petri dish in the picture. Find Antibiotic disks Then the app finds the antibiotic bellets (small white disks). If something went wrong, the user can edit and adjust the result (in zoomed mode). \nRead antibiotic names The app reads the name of the antibiotics, printed on each white disk. \nMeasure the inhibition diameters The app measures the \u0026ldquo;inhibition diameters\u0026rdquo;, the size of those zones where the bacteria did not grow in proximity of an effective antibiotic. Once again, the user can adjust the automatic measurements. \nGet the interpreted results With the previously meausred diameters are converted in Resistance information. The app show this result to the user, together with its interpretation: a set of rules is applied to the measured result to extrapolate other resistances. "

It aims do develop an application for portable devices helping to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is expecially designed to be used in low-resource settings.\nHow it works The resistance of a bacteria to antibiotics is tested via antibiograms.\nASTapp takes a picture of an antibiogram and gives an interpreted result of the antibiotic susceptibility of the observer bacteria colony, using image processing and artificial intelligence.\nThis result is used by clinicians to prescribe the right antibiotics.\n"
