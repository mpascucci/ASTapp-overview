	"content": " Our project aims to fight the spread of antimicrobial resistance and grant equal access to proper diagnosis all over the word. Discover ASTapp here.\n Antimicrobial Resistance As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO AMR review), Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a major public health concern. In 50 years it could become  the first cause of death all over the world.\nThe access to a good diagnosis of bacterial deseases is usually not available in low-resource settings (LRS). This leads to non appropriate patient treatment and to the selection of resistant strains because of the non rational use of broad spectrum antibiotics.\n   The antibiogram Antibiograms are an easy-to-implement test for detecting bacteria resistances to antibiotics. This video carefully explains the principle.   The raw result of an antibiogram needs to be interpreted by a microbiologist, and microbiologists are a rare in in low resource settings.\n The Solution a free diagnosis tool ASTapp allows the interpretation of an antibiogram by tacking a picture of it with a smarthpone camera.\nASTapp addresses several of the strategic objectives identified by the World Health organization (WHO) as a global action plan to tackle Antimicrobial resistance. By giving a broad and open access to a better diagnosis, ourproject can:\n \u0026ldquo;strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;optimize the use of antimicrobial agents\u0026rdquo;\n  ASTapp has an educational vocation too: throughout the automated antibiogram interpretation, it will explain its choices to the user and teach him how to avoid mistakes.\n"

	"content": " Application home The user enters the relevant data for the analysis, then takes a picture of the antibiogram with the device camera. Petri dish selection The analysis begins with a step-by-step validation process, where ASTapp asks the user to validate or adjust its automatic results. Here, the app finds the petri dish in the picture. Find Antibiotic disks Then, ASTapp finds the antibiotic antibiotic pellets (small white disks). If something went wrong, the user can edit and adjust the result (with a zoomed view). \nRead antibiotic names ASTapp reads the name of the antibiotics, printed on each white disk. \nMeasure the inhibition diameters ASTapp measures the \u0026ldquo;inhibition diameters\u0026rdquo;, the size of the zones where the bacteria did not grow in proximity of an effective antibiotic. Once again, the user can adjust the automatic measurements. \nGet the interpreted results With the previously meausred diameters are converted in resistance information. ASTapp shows this result to the user, together with its interpretation: a set of rules is applied to the measured result to check the overall coherence and extrapolate resistances to other (non-tested) antibiotics.
