	"content": " Our project aims to fight the spread of antimicrobial resistance and grant equal access to proper diagnosis all over the word. Discover here ASTapp.\n Antimicrobial Resistance As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO AMR review), Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a major public health concern, In 50 years it could become the first cause of death all over the world (10 million of death every year in 2050 according the Oâ€™Neill report, thereby surpassing cancer.\nThe access to a good diagnosis of bacterial deseases is usually not available in low-resource settings (LRS). This leads to non appropriate patient treatment and to the selection of resistant strains because of the non rational use of broad spectrum antibiotics.\n   The antibiogram Antibiograms are an easy-to-implement test for detecting bacteria resistances to antibiotics. This video carefully explains the principle.   The raw result of an antibiogram needs an interpratation, which in turn requires highly specialized human resources (microbiologists, a rare resource in LRS).\n The Solution ASTapp: a diagnosis tool for everybody Astapp addresses several of the strategic objectives identified by the World Health organization (WHO) as a global action plan to tackle Antimicrobial resistance. By giving a broad and open access to a better diagnosis, ourproject can:\n \u0026ldquo;strengthen knowledge through surveillance and research\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;optimize the use of antimicrobial agents\u0026rdquo;\n  Our application has also an educational vocation: througout the automated antibiogram interpretation, it will explain its choices to the user.\n"

	"content": " Application home The user enters the relevant data for the analysis, then takes a picture of the antibiogram. Petri dish selection The analysis begins, with a step by step validation process, where the app asks the user to validate or adjust the automatic results. Here, the app finds the petri dish in the picture. Find Antibiotic disks Then the app finds the antibiotic bellets (small white disks). If something went wrong, the user can edit and adjust the result (in zoomed mode). \nRead antibiotic names The app reads the name of the antibiotics, printed on each white disk. \nMeasure the inhibition diameters The app measures the \u0026ldquo;inhibition diameters\u0026rdquo;, the size of those zones where the bacteria did not grow in proximity of an effective antibiotic. Once again, the user can adjust the automatic measurements. \nGet the interpreted results With the previously meausred diameters are converted in Resistance information. The app show this result to the user, together with its interpretation: a set of rules is applied to the measured result to extrapolate other resistances. "
